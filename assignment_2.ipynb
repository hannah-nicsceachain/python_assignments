    "- Check individually each function by invoking it.\n",
    "- Check that functions which return floating point number, you round them to 1 decimal point.\n",
    "- Clean up your notebook before exporting it to Python format: remove unnecessary cells where you performed tests...\n",
    "- Check that the Python file do not contain any syntax error:\n",
    "    * Open a command window and type: python assignment_2.py\n",
