# python_bootcamp_assignments

In semester 1 of my MSc in Digital Marketing & Data Science at emlyon, I completed a Python Bootcamp where I discovered Python programming concepts. My primary objective for this Bootcamp was to be able to apply what I learned to perform powerful analytics on consumer or transactional data. <br />
In the Bootcamp I covered <br />
•	An Introduction to Python <br />
•	Data structures <br />
•	Data management and processing <br />
•	Data visualisation <br />
all while using Python, Python standard library, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc… <br />
I’m excited to continue my journey learning Python! Check out the assignments I completed where I was awarded a grade of 19/20.
